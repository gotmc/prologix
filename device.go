Package prologix communicates with either the Prologix GPIB-USB or
GPIB-ETHERNET controller. Communication with the GPIB-USB controller can either
be via the FTDI Virtual COM Port (VCP) driver or via the FTDI D2XX direct
driver. The Prologix GPIB controller can operate as a GPIB Controller-in-Charge
(CIC), a GPIB Talker Device, or a GPIB Listener Device.
